  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There are purists that would have you believe that programming is something best done with a plain text editor, Vim, and/or the command line, and they are (for the most part) absolutely correct. However, for those that are <em>not</em> purists, (insofar as not respecting that particular aesthetic) there are very powerful and flexible tools available. One such tool is Sublime Text. To be clear, I think that programmers <em>should</em> be able to get by with nothing but a plain text editor and the command line. When not “in the field,” on my own computer, I like to have a bit more of a personalized experience.</p>

<hr />
<p>#### Reasons for my choosing Sublime Text</p>

<p>This will seem silly to the more seasoned among you, but one of my first reasons for choosing Sublime Text was syntax highlighting of many languages. This comes in handy when you’re handed a program written in Fortran on your first day of graduate research (having only heard of Fortran referred to jokingly up to this point) and have no idea how to pick it apart. Now Sublime Text doesn’t have the built-in ability to syntax highlight Fortran, but it only took about five minutes and a Google search to configure it to do so. That is one prominent feature of Sublime Text, possibly <em>the</em> feature: it’s customizability/configurability.</p>

<p>I also chose Sublime Text because of something called “Package Control.” Package Control is a repository for—you guessed it—packages that can be installed within Sublime Text to augment its capabilities. It is incredibly easy to set up (again, a single Google search turns up everything you need to know) and to use once it is installed. An example of a package in Package Control is “MarkdownEditing” which is not-so-coincidentally what I am writing this post with. There are also “Themes” and “Color Schemes” to download; this adds another layer of that “personal touch” to the editor (I’ll share some of my favorite packages, themes, and color schemes later). All of this is maintained by a very active community of contributors.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that Sublime Text is exactly what I wanted from a programming text editor. I have even developed a weird sense of pride in my configuration because I think it is a reflection of how I work and huge contributor to my workflow.</p>

<p>A critique of this post may be that I haven’t discussed the fact that Sublime Text isn’t free, so let’s take care of that: it’s not free. You can download the editor for free and use its full capabilities, but you will occasionally be reminded that your copy is “UNREGISTERED”. It costs 70 dollars for a personal license that you can install on any computer you own, for personal use. I took into consideration that those 70 dollars were going to help develop this wonderful piece of software, so I decided to buy a license. However, that may not be the case for everyone and there are other options, my favorite of which I will mention later.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="some-of-my-favorite-features">Some of my favorite features</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Multiple edit
    <ul>
      <li>You can actually select multiple spots in your code and batch edit several lines at a time. When combined with a robust “Find/Find All” function, this can save a lot of time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Build systems
    <ul>
      <li>It is possible to create your very own “Build systems,” which are files that specify a way to compile, build, and even execute source code files in any way you see fit. This is very nice for prototyping some of the programs I write for my thesis research because I would have to use the same commands over and over (and over) in a terminal rather than just a single keystroke in Sublime Text.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Snippets
    <ul>
      <li>These little buggers are things that you would have to type repeatedly from memory were it not for the “Snippets” in Sublime Text. For example, to insert a figure with a caption in Markdown, I made a little snippet that types out the relevant HTML so <em>I don’t have to</em>. I just type “ffigure”, hit the Tab key, and I’m off to the races.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Multiple panes
    <ul>
      <li>You can have two files open simultaneously, alongside one another (or three, four, etc. in various arrangements). This is nice if I’m using one file as a reference for another or if one is the header and the other on of the source code files.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The settings
    <ul>
      <li>The user-configurable settings are easy to access and you can change just about anything about how Sublime Text looks and behaves from these settings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These are really just a few of the capabilities, but they are some of my most frequently utilized.</p>

<h4 id="my-other-favorite-free-text-editor-notepad">My other favorite (free) text editor: Notepad++</h4>

<p>Notepad++ is free and frequently updated. It has some of the same potential for augmentation as Sublime Text and is lauded as being the best (which is why I’m not belaboring the point here). The only quibble I have consistently read about Notepad++ is that it is “not pretty,” to which I say “Who honestly cares?” Vim, Gedit, and other text editors aren’t absolutely visually stunning; that’s not why we use them (end short rant).</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h4>

<p>If you’re in the market for a great (premium) programming text editor that is as powerful as it is fun to tweak, Sublime Text is for you. I think it would be safe to say that I haven’t gone a solid day without using it in the last two years (which I’m just now realizing might be a little sad).</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="http://lmarkley.github.io/favorite-apps/" rel="bookmark" title="My favorite iOS applications" itemprop="url">My favorite iOS applications</a></h1>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Below I have collected my favorite iOS applications. I have spent a long time vetting the applications in this post, and I plan to add and subtract from it as necessary.</p>

<h3 id="email-client-dispatch">Email client: Dispatch</h3>

<p>I haven’t been able to find an email client application that can replace Dispatch on iOS. And that’s saying something because I have tried, just to prove a point.</p>

<p>This “app” (one of the most overused words anymore) is a productivity powerhouse. You can export messages in a variety of formats (PDF, PNG, text, etc.) and send emails to a variety of third-party applications for parsing or storing. For example, when I get an important email with a timeframe, I can send it to Todoist (more on Todoist later) and create a task with a due date, reminders, a specific priority, and keep things organized by putting it in the proper “project”.</p>

<p>Another wonderful thing about Dispatch is the overall UI/UX. It’s a beautiful app; simple, clean, and easy to use. I have a lot of folders in my email accounts, and I can pick the most used ones to be pinned to a side bar.</p>

<p>Finally, the swipes: they are customizable and easy to use.</p>

<p>I recommend Dispatch to people who like combining the use of other services with their email workflow, and who might be considered “power users”. It is a powerful tool if you know how to use it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dispatchapp.net">Dispatch: Action-based email</a></p>

<h3 id="task-manager-todoist">Task manager: Todoist</h3>

<p>I hate to sound like a shameless fanboy, but Todoist <em>made me more productive</em>. It is an intuitive program with a gentle learning curve. The UI is simple. You add tasks, you complete them. You can make it as robust as you want by adding projects, sub-tasks, tags, and reminders.</p>

<p>My favorite feature, however, is “Karma”. You earn Karma for finishing tasks. I use it to compete with myself; to see if I can get more done this week than last.</p>

<p>I recommend Todoist to people who like keeping track of what they get done, a good system of self-reinforcement, and a simple interface but powerful interface.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.todoist.com">Todoist website</a></p>

<h3 id="for-editing-code-on-the-go-textastic">For editing code on the go: Textastic</h3>

<p>I have tried a few applications for editing code on my iPhone (it seems silly, but a little necessary change here or there happens so often that it becomes justified quickly), but the best that I’ve come across is Textastic. It has support for nearly any programming language you can throw at it and has good syntax highlighting themes. It also has the ability to link to cloud storage and SFTP servers, which is useful for working remotely.</p>

<p>The interface is very simple: you can add remote sites, download files, edit files, create new ones, etc. all with a few swipes of the thumb. It really doesn’t get any more straightforward, and the utility speaks for itself. I recommend this application to anyone who needs to edit a variety of files on the go, or even just write ideas down in plain text or markdown.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.textasticapp.com">Textastic website</a></p>

<h3 id="writing-on-the-go-editorial">Writing on the go: Editorial</h3>

<p>To say that Editorial is <em>just</em> a writing app would be do it a great disservice; it is a very flexible, customizable text editor with the ability to create workflows and scripting to increase productivity and generally just do some really neat stuff.</p>

<p>For example, most of the first iteration of this post was written in and published from Editorial using user-created and submitted workflows. Workflows can be as simple as copying all of the text as plain text or HTML, to interacting with APIs and uploading a blog post to GitHub (as was done here).</p>

<p>Not only is Editorial useful, it is also very clean, well-crafted, and a pleasure to use.</p>

<p><a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial for iOS</a></p>

<h3 id="notes-and-then-some-drafts-4">Notes (and then some): Drafts 4</h3>

<p>Drafts 4 is one of those apps that you may see and say, “$10 for a note-taking app?!”. However, let me say that, much like with Editorial, saying that this is just a note-taking app is doing it a disservice. Drafts 4 is great for jotting down a quick note, no two ways about it. But what do you do with that note once you’ve written it down? With Drafts, you can do any number of things like searching for an address you’ve written down, adding a task in Todoist (or another app with a <strong>URL Scheme</strong><sup id="fnref:schemes"><a href="#fn:schemes" class="footnote">1</a></sup>), or adding links to a read-it-later app; it uses short “actions” to do these things with the text you supply.</p>

<h3 id="swiss-army-knife-pythonista">Swiss army knife: Pythonista</h3>

<p>I’ve been waiting to write about Pythonista because I wasn’t sure how to categorize it. What category do you put an application that can do almost anything? So I decided to make one up.</p>

<p>Pythonista is nominally an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Python 2.7. As I’m writing this (on 1 August 2015), Pythonista is in version 1.5 with version 1.6 being actively vetted by the developer and a lively (and friendly) community of contributors. As an IDE, you are able to write and run code written in Python 2.7 in a sort of “sandbox” in the app, natively on iOS. This opens a multitude of potential uses. A few functions that I know of are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an integrated web browser,</li>
  <li>interactions with various sensor in your device,</li>
  <li>access to the clipboard,</li>
  <li>static website creation (made possible by an integrated HTTP server),</li>
  <li>an extremely robust and flexible math library (numpy) and graphing library (matplotlib) that make a very powerful graphing calculator,</li>
  <li>ways to interact with APIs, such as that of Dropbox or Philips Hue,</li>
  <li>and even access to new modules and scripts from the vast frontier of the Internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just what I’ve encountered; they barely scratch the <em>current</em> capabilities of the application. Capabilities that are bound to expand in the next iteration.</p>

<p>I started off using Python to prototype algorithms for my research in computational physics (yes, it’s that good) and have even used it for experimenting in my graduate-level computer science classes. I’ll include some code I wrote <em>entirely</em> in Pythonista below (part of a proof-of-concept RSA algorithm implementation).</p>

<p><em>Note</em> this is an implementation of Fermat’s Little Theorem, a test of primality. I can’t really vouch for how well it works, but it worked for my very basic purposes. I just wanted to show how easy writing code is in Pythonista.</p>

<pre><code>def fermat ( prime_length ):
	if prime_length &lt;= 0:
		return 0;
	N = random.randrange(mod_pow(10,prime_length-1), mod_pow(10,prime_length))
	if (N%2) == 0:
		N += 1
	correct = 0
	for i in xrange(0,20):
		test_num = random.randint(1,N-1)
		if mod_pow(test_num,N-1,N) == 1:
			correct = correct + 1
	if correct &gt;= 19:
		return N;
	else:
		return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>My personal opinion is that Pythonista is the most useful, most well-crafted application I have ever used or heard of. The developer is an artist as much as he is a gifted programmer. I recommend it to beginning and advanced programmers alike.</p>

<h3 id="the-ultimate-remote-access-utility-bundle-prompt-2-transmit-and-coda">The ultimate remote access utility bundle: Prompt 2, Transmit, and Coda</h3>

<p>All of these applications are made by a company called Panic. They make apps of superior quality, so I recommend them as an entity to programmers and especially web designers/programmers.</p>

<h4 id="prompt-2">Prompt 2</h4>

<p>Prompt 2 is a well-designed and easy to use SSH client. Have RSA keys for password-less authentication? Great. Prompt has you covered with a sort of “keychain” for them. It also has a repository for snippets, commonly used commands or sequences of commands, that can be global or site specific. You can also group your sites into folders to stay organized.</p>

<h4 id="transmit">Transmit</h4>

<p>Transmit is a remote file access client that can use a variety of protocols. To reiterate my description of Prompt, it is well-designed. It has a local file manager also, so that you can create and upload or download and edit files right on your device.</p>

<h4 id="coda-for-ios">Coda (for iOS)</h4>

<p>I purchased “Diet Coda” for the iPad about two years ago (the spiritual predecessor to Coda for iOS) and was elated to see it had been updated. Of course, by “updated” I mean completely rewritten and redesigned. The only minor annoyance is that it had been rewritten to encompass the functionality of Prompt 2 and Transmit, so I wish I could have just bought it first. However, all things considered, I have gotten my money’s worth out of all three, so no hard feelings, Panic. Thanks for writing great apps.</p>

<p>Back to the functionality of the app. Remote sites can be organized into folders, keys can still be added and saved, and snippets can also be saved for use globally and site-specifically. One little detail that I absolutely love is that I can load a custom font and use it in the editor. Which is nice because I really like this font, <a href="https://github.com/larsenwork/monoid">Monoid</a>, on GitHub. As a matter of fact, so much attention to detail has been put into this app that there are lots of neat little bonuses hidden throughout the application.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>It turns out that computers that are good for doing complex mathematics, large calculation, and parallel processing, are also good for gaming. Interestingly enough, gaming keyboards are also good for things other than gaming. They happen to be, for the most part, well-crafted, mechanical, and possess macro keys that can be used in many ways. In this post, I would like to give an anecdotal look at how a gaming keyboard can be repurposed for productivity, particularly with regard to programming.</p>

<h2 id="macro-keys-shortcuts-galore">Macro keys: shortcuts galore</h2>

<p>I have a Logitech G910 “Orion Spark”<sup id="fnref:Orion"><a href="#fn:Orion" class="footnote">1</a></sup> with a numerical pad and also nine programmable macro keys <sup id="fnref:keys"><a href="#fn:keys" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. With Logitech’s Gaming Software, you can assign these macro keys to a regular old single key, a many-key shortcut, a macro, or even to enter a block of text. Basically, you can have those keys do <em>anything</em> you can come up with.</p>

<figure> <a href="http://lmarkley.github.io/images/asset.tif"><img src="http://lmarkley.github.io/images/asset.tif" /></a>The Logitech G910 "Orion Spark" as I have it set up now. The keys light up as I press them!</figure>

<p>For example, I use one such macro key to enter my signature for emails. This may not seem very useful at first, but if you write a lot of emails for different purposes, it’s nice to have a way to add a signature when needed sporadically. I have another couple of macros that launch my Cygwin terminal (currently using the Babun distribution from an <a href="http://particles.fitzlarolds.net/Nmap-and-other-things/">earlier post</a>) and send commands to connect to an SSH session on a remote machine. This reduces my clicking and typing to a single keystroke. These are some <em>simple</em> examples of things you can do with macros; I am finding new uses every time I log in to my computer.</p>

<h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts-with-autohotkey">Keyboard shortcuts with AutoHotkey</h3>

<p>Many programs come with multi-key, system-wide shortcuts, and many don’t. A way around this is to use <a href="http://ahkscript.org/">AutoHotkey</a> to set up your own keyboard shortcut for any program you want <sup id="fnref:ahk"><a href="#fn:ahk" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. To be honest, I haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of what AutoHotkey is capable of. You can do anything from remapping keys to increase productivity, to launching GUIs to run much more complicated applications. I have a shortcut that just launches my favorite terminal emulator. I also have a shortcut to change my wallpaper to a random image in a folder I’ve designated. The others that I have made work in conjunction with the Logitech Gaming Software to enter more complicated streams of text, even prompting for user input occasionally.</p>

<h3 id="other-remarks">Other remarks</h3>

<p>I recommend having some macros or shortcuts to anyone that does a lot of repetitive tasks on their computer and want to optimize their workflow. I know that the above isn’t much of an introduction, but as I learn more, I will add more to this post (so we can learn together!).</p>

      <p>This is a really nice keyboard. At first I thought it looked a little excessive; the little stand for your smart phone seemed like a silly gimmick (and still does). However, the ease of use of the software and the build quality outweighed my initial trepidation. <a href="#fnref:Orion" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I’ve been playing around with bash (the Bourne Again SHell) scripts for about two years now. At first, it was a passing necessity to automate programs for the research I was working on. Then I realized the tremendous power that lie within scripting in bash. I think about it like this: You are essentially giving directions <em>directly</em> to the “brain” of your computer. All that raw power at your fingertips without having to go through someone else’s “black box” of a user interface, that does god-knows-what behind the scenes; it is exhilarating (to a nerd like me).</p>

<p>That is not to say that you can’t <strong>severely</strong> screw up everything on your computer with this stuff (I have on many occasions done just that), but if you do your homework and experiment a little you’re usually safe.</p>

<h3 id="ssh-scp--sftp">SSH, SCP, &amp; SFTP</h3>

<p>I do a lot of work remotely. Needless to say, I don’t want everyone in the world to be able to pick what I’m doing out of the air and have access to any personal data. So I employ the use of SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption in the form of SSH, SCP, and SFTP; which are Secure SHell, Secure CoPy, and Secure File Transfer Protocol, respectively. You may have heard of SSL, it is responsible for encrypting anything from secure chats to bank transfers, and with the exception of a few problems (like Heartbleed) it has worked well (especially for being open-source and staffed by mostly volunteers as I understand it). I won’t go into the details of exactly how it works (I don’t understand it fully, so I wouldn’t feel comfortable), but I might throw in an example or two later on. Of the three, I use SSH the most to run remote commands to do work while I’m away (and even to tunnel a VNC session if I have enough bandwidth).</p>

<h4 id="ssh">SSH</h4>

<p>SSH has pretty simple syntax for the most basic applications. For example, if I want to log on to a server called ‘myserver’ with the username ‘bob’, on the port ‘2468’ (the default port for SSH is 22, for future reference), I would enter the following in the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -p 2468 bob@myserver
</code></pre>

<p>Then SSH would prompt me for the password for ‘bob’, unless I have an SSH key <sup id="fnref:keys"><a href="#fn:keys" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Another cool thing possible with SSH is <em>tunneling</em>. It might sound a bit nefarious, but it’s used for all sorts of practical things from creating a “poor man’s VPN”, to circumventing restrictive firewalls, or even just being able to get desktop Gmail at work. There are many types of tunnels, but the one I will share here (without telling you how to do everything, that may require a bit of searching) is for a <em>dynamic port forwarding tunnel</em>. In other words, it forwards all of the traffic on your computer through a remote server to the rest of the Internet. This can be done with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -D &lt;local port&gt; &lt;user&gt;@&lt;server&gt; -N
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>D</code> is for dynamic and it takes a port on your local computer as an argument, the <code>N</code> is so you don’t enter what is called an interactive session (i.e. you can’t send commands). It always makes things a little easier to use password-less authentication, but that lies beyond the scope of this post.</p>

<h4 id="scp">SCP</h4>

<p>The Secure CoPy (SCP) tool can be very useful if you need to send a file to or get a file from somewhere that you don’t have physical access to (and possibly don’t want to use an SFTP or FTP client, etc.). Again, the syntax is pretty simple for basic stuff. For example, let’s say I have the same computer as above and I want to send a shell script (‘script.sh’) in my home directory (or in the second case, get a shell script <em>from</em> the home directory of ‘myserver’), then I would enter these commands in the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>scp -P 2468 shell.sh bob@myserver:~/
</code></pre>

<p>or to fetch the same file:</p>

<pre><code>scp -P 2468 bob@myserver:~/shell.sh ~/
</code></pre>

<p>The same thing goes here; you’ll be prompted for a password unless you have an SSH key.</p>

<h3 id="network-tools">Network tools</h3>

<p>There are some really nice network tools available for bash. I’ll go over a few (there are <em>tons</em>) here and give a brief overview of some things that they can do.</p>

<h4 id="ping">Ping</h4>

<p>Ping is probably the best known of all of the network tools (possibly even command line tools) in bash. It has extensive applications, but most commonly I use it to see how well one computer (a client) is communicating with another (a host). For example, if I wanted to see if my computer was communicating well with my router (located at, say, 10.0.0.1 which is an IP address) I would enter</p>

<pre><code>ping 10.0.0.1
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it! Then it will send some information to the host and see how much it gets back. The more it gets back, the better. Again, that’s not all, but it’s enough to get you going!</p>

<h4 id="arp">Arp</h4>

<p>ARP stands for “Address Resolution Protocol”. It is how computers know where one another are, and how to get from point A to point B (so to speak) in a network. The <code>arp -a</code> returns the ARP table for the network you are connected to, with all of the live hosts (network devices that are connected and on) and their IP and MAC addresses. This is useful information if you want to know how many devices are connected to your network and “where” they are on it.</p>

<h4 id="nmap">Nmap</h4>

<p>Nmap doesn’t come stock with bash; it is third party software but it is one of my favorites so I’m mentioning it. Before I go on, the obligatory disclaimer: <strong>DO NOT USE NMAP ANYWHERE YOU SHOULDN’T</strong> and <strong>IF YOU AREN’T SURE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO USE IT, YOU PROBABLY AREN’T</strong>. Now that we’ve that out of the way, Nmap is an incredibly powerful and versatile information gathering tool. It scans the nebulous entities known as ports on a computer; can gather information about the operating system and services available from a computer; and various other features that are rather esoteric. I personally use it to look for my computer when its IP address changes on my local network and I’m not there to check what it might be. There is a GUI version of Nmap called Zenmap that is rather nifty as well. You can find information about Nmap and Zenmap on <a href="https://nmap.org">the official Nmap site</a><sup id="fnref:nmap"><a href="#fn:nmap" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="file-and-text-tools">File and text tools</h3>

<h4 id="vi-or-vim"><code>vi</code> (or Vim)</h4>

<p>Possibly the most powerful tool at the fingertips of any computer software tinkerer is a good text editor. Luckily, <code>vi</code> is a <em>great</em> text editor, often lauded as <em>the</em> text editor. I have to admit, I’ve gotten a bit rusty in my Vim skills. I’ve been spoiled with Sublime Text for some time now. Though having a big, fancy text editor is great, what happens when you don’t have those luxuries like a mouse or a user interface? Vim is a veritable (and venerable) Swiss army knife; you <em>need</em> to keep it in your pocket, especially out in the wild. To get back to the practical point, <code>vi</code> is completely text-based and uses keyboard shortcuts to keep your hands on the keyboard. While it is easy to pick up the basics, becoming proficient can be tough (but it’s worth it).</p>

<p>I am actually editing this section of this post in Vim now. I have to say, even being rusty, the shortcuts and syntax highlighting are still incredible and fast.</p>

<h3 id="other-tools">Other tools</h3>

<h4 id="tmux"><code>tmux</code></h4>

<p>It is my understanding that <code>tmux</code> is short for ‘terminal multiplexer’, which means that you can have multiple instances of shell in the same terminal session in the form of panes or windows.</p>

<figure> <a href="http://lmarkley.github.io/images/tmux.png"><img src="http://lmarkley.github.io/images/tmux.png" /></a> A screenshot of writing this post in Vim using tmux panes.</figure>

<h3 id="other-cool-stuff">Other cool stuff</h3>

<h4 id="babun">Babun</h4>

<p>I discovered <a href="http://babun.github.io">Babun</a> a few days ago after hearing it on a podcast called “Programming Throwdown” which, by the way, is wonderful. You should listen to it. It’s funny <em>and</em> informative, though I will warn you that the nominal topic only gets about 15-20 minutes toward the end of the show in my experience <sup id="fnref:progthrow"><a href="#fn:progthrow" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Babun is an implementation of Cygwin and a lot more; it has many plugins and add-ons and one thing that Cygwin lacks out-of-the-box: an included package manager. It’s easy to setup and, as the home page states, doesn’t interfere with previous Cygwin installations (I can vouch for that, it didn’t mess with mine at all). If you are a Windows user but miss a good (sorry Microsoft…) command line interface, try Babun.</p>

<h4 id="atom">Atom</h4>

<p>Atom is “A hackable text editor for the 21st Century” as the website states. It is free; open-source; and has a plethora of themes, packages, and add-ons for increased utility. I started using Atom well before its 1.0 date, but found it difficult to work with on Windows. This has since changed; it is as simple to install and use as double clicking the installer and starting it up. It is also cross-platform, which is very nice for a person who uses Linux, OS X, and Windows on a rotating basis (occasionally two simultaneously, which can get really confusing) like me. It is <em>very</em> customizable and chic, and I recommend giving it a shot if you like free, open-source, awesome stuff <sup id="fnref:atom"><a href="#fn:atom" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I was perusing the selection on Steam a couple of days ago and ran across something that intrigued me: a game survival game with dinosaurs. I should preface the following with the fact that I <em>do not</em> generally like survival games, <em>do not</em> generally like games where humans and dinosaurs coexist (anything in which they coexist, actually), and am a bit wary of “Early Access” titles (I have been disappointed in the past). However, after watching the (rather intense) trailer <sup id="fnref:trailer"><a href="#fn:trailer" class="footnote">1</a></sup> for <em>ARK: Survival Evolved</em>, I took a chance; there was bait dangled in front of me and I bit.</p>

<h3 id="the-premise-and-basis-of-gameplay">The premise and basis of gameplay</h3>

<p>From what I can glean from the description of the game on Steam and what I have experienced thus far, the premise is that you are a human (male or female) that wakes up on a mysterious island with nothing but your skin and a strange, alien implant in your left arm. As you come to, you can look around and see that this island is lush and rich in resources, but also rich in something else: dinosaurs (and other interesting fauna <sup id="fnref:dodo"><a href="#fn:dodo" class="footnote">2</a></sup>). The player must negotiate gathering resources, finding shelter, warmth, shade, water, food, and even relieving one’s self from time to time (complete with a humorous sound effect).</p>

<p>There are RPG elements in the game; for example, there are “Engram Points” that are used to obtain new “blueprints” for various crafted items that can be made once learned. There is also an upgrade system in which you can augment your health, stamina, water capacity, etc. I found this system to be simple to learn and intuitive to manage. If my character is thirsty, I find water; hungry, (towards the beginning) I eat some berries <sup id="fnref:tutorial"><a href="#fn:tutorial" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="graphics">Graphics</h3>

<p>The largest complaint I have read about this game is the low framerate on many machines. I have experienced this phenomenon as well, but most of the time it is barely noticeable on my laptop.</p>

<p>That being said, the landscape, creatures, water, and motion are all something to behold and are rendered beautifully. I first played on a public server and the graphics were phenomenal. Since then I have played locally on my laptop (which is no slouch) and the game is still rendered beautifully, though not quite as well as on the server, as expected. Below are some screenshots from the server and my laptop.</p>

<figure> <a href="http://drops.fitzlarolds.net/1bpdy+"><img src="http://drops.fitzlarolds.net/1bpdy+" /></a> <figcaption>In game graphics while playing on the public server.</figcaption></figure>

<figure> <a href="http://drops.fitzlarolds.net/1irSC+"><img src="http://drops.fitzlarolds.net/1irSC+" /></a> <figcaption>In game graphics while playing locally on my laptop.</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="summation">Summation</h3>

<p>As stated in the title, this is very much a statement of my initial impressions, which can be summed up like this: “Wow.” I think that if this is how the game is in “Early Access”, I can’t wait to see what it’s like as a full release.</p>

<p>I would say that if you’ve got the time and an extra thirty or so dollars, get this game.</p>

    </li>
    <li id="fn:dodo">
      <p>Not the least of which is the amusing Dodo. The game has, I believe, about 40 species of creatures (some hostile, some not) with more planned. <a href="#fnref:dodo" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:tutorial">
      <p>There is no real tutorial element to the game; you are thrown in with the controls and common sense. What might you actually do to survive in this environment?
