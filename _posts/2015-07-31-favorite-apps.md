## Email client: Dispatch

I haven't been able to find an email client application that can replace Dispatch on iOS. And that's saying something because I have tried, just to prove a point. 

This "app" (one of the most overused words anymore) is a productivity powerhouse. You can export messages in a variety of formats (PDF, PNG, text, etc.) and send emails to a variety of third-party applications for parsing or storing. For example, when I get an important email with a timeframe, I can send it to Todoist (more on Todoist later) and create a task with a due date, reminders, a specific priority, and keep things organized by putting it in the proper "project".

Another wonderful thing about Dispatch is the overall UI/UX. It's a beautiful app; simple, clean, and easy to use. I have a lot of folders in my email accounts, and I can pick the most used ones to be pinned to a side bar.

Finally, the swipes: they are customizable and easy to use. 

Overall, I'd give Dispatch a 99.0% grade. The 1% deduction is for the lack of background email fetching and push notifications. They aren't incredibly important for me because I check my email too much, but many people rely on them.

## Task manager: Todoist

I hate to sound like a shameless fanboy, but Todoist *made me more productive*. It is an intuitive program with a gentle learning curve. The UI is simple. You add tasks, you complete them. You can make it as robust as you want by adding projects, sub-tasks, tags, and reminders.

My favorite feature, however, is "Karma". You earn Karma for finishing tasks. I use it to compete with myself; to see if I can get more done this week than last.

I give Todoist a 100%, because I'm biased.
