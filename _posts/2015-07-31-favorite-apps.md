Below I have collected my favorite iOS applications. I have spent a long time vetting the applications in this post, and I plan to add and subtract from it as necessary.

### Email client: Dispatch

I haven't been able to find an email client application that can replace Dispatch on iOS. And that's saying something because I have tried, just to prove a point.

This "app" (one of the most overused words anymore) is a productivity powerhouse. You can export messages in a variety of formats (PDF, PNG, text, etc.) and send emails to a variety of third-party applications for parsing or storing. For example, when I get an important email with a timeframe, I can send it to Todoist (more on Todoist later) and create a task with a due date, reminders, a specific priority, and keep things organized by putting it in the proper "project".

Another wonderful thing about Dispatch is the overall UI/UX. It's a beautiful app; simple, clean, and easy to use. I have a lot of folders in my email accounts, and I can pick the most used ones to be pinned to a side bar.

Finally, the swipes: they are customizable and easy to use.

I recommend Dispatch to people who like combining the use of other services with their email workflow, and who might be considered "power users". It is a powerful tool if you know how to use it.

### Task manager: Todoist

I hate to sound like a shameless fanboy, but Todoist *made me more productive*. It is an intuitive program with a gentle learning curve. The UI is simple. You add tasks, you complete them. You can make it as robust as you want by adding projects, sub-tasks, tags, and reminders.

My favorite feature, however, is "Karma". You earn Karma for finishing tasks. I use it to compete with myself; to see if I can get more done this week than last.

I recommend Todoist to people who like keeping track of what they get done, a good system of self-reinforcement, and a simple interface but powerful interface.

### For editing code on the go: Textastic

I have tried a few applications for editing code on my iPhone (it seems silly, but a little necessary change here or there happens so often that it becomes justified quickly), but the best that I've come across is Textastic. It has support for nearly any programming language you can throw at it and has good syntax highlighting themes. It also has the ability to link to cloud storage and SFTP servers, which is useful for working remotely.

The interface is very simple: you can add remote sites, download files, edit files, create new ones, etc. all with a few swipes of the thumb. It really doesn't get any more straightforward, and the utility speaks for itself. I recommend this application to anyone who needs to edit a variety of files on the go, or even just write ideas down in plain text or markdown.

### Writing on the go: Editorial

To say that Editorial is *just* a writing app would be do it a great disservice; it is a very flexible, customizable text editor with the ability to create workflows and scripting to increase productivity and generally just do some really neat stuff.

For example, most of the first iteration of this post was written in and published from Editorial using user-created and submitted workflows. Workflows can be as simple as copying all of the text as plain text or HTML, to interacting with APIs and uploading a blog post to GitHub (as was done here).

Not only is Editorial useful, it is also very clean, well-crafted, and a pleasure to use.

Notes (and then some): Drafts 4

Drafts 4 is one of those apps that you may see and say, "$10 for a note-taking app?!". However, let me say that, much like with Editorial, saying that this is just a note-taking app is doing it a disservice. Drafts 4 is great for jotting down a quick note, no two ways about it. But what do you do with that note once you've written it down? With Drafts, you can do any number of things like searching for an address you've written down, adding a task in Todoist (or another app with a **URL Scheme**), or adding links to a read-it-later app; it uses short "actions" to do these things with the text you supply.
