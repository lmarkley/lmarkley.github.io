## My first post with Jekyll...

And I must say, setting this up was relatively easy. 

The concept behind Jekyll and GitHub pages is absolutely wonderful. I know this because even *I* could figure it out in a few minutes. 

Let's test some math: $ E = mc^2 $ See?! Even that was easy to get working!

Well anyway, hopefully I will write some interesting things here in the future. For now, it is just a fun experiment!
