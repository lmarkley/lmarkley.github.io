## My first post with Jekyll...

And I must say, setting this up was relatively easy. 

The concept behind Jekyll and GitHub pages is absolutely wonderful. I know this because even *I* could figure it out in a few minutes. 

Let's test some math:

$ E = mc^2 $

<script type="text/x-mathjax-config"> MathJax.Hub.Config({tex2jax: {inlineMath: [['$','$'],['\[','\]']], processEscapes: true}}); </script> 
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"> </script>
