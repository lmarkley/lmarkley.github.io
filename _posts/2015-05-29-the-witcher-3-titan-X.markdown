I recently had the chance to try out the GeForce GTX Titan X. The Titan X is NVIDIA's new high-end consumer card; not "pro-sumer", just consumer. The reason behind this is that the Titan X, unlike its nominal forebears, is optimized for 32-bit floating point arithmetic, not 64-bit and thus is amazing at graphics, but not ideal for scientific or professional computing *technically*. Despite its 64-bit limitations, it has 8 billion transistors on its 28 nm lithography, with the second-generation Maxwell architecture [^transistors] The card comes with a wonderfully large amount of VRAM: 12 GB, to be exact. This makes it great for handling the large buffer sizes associated with 4K gaming.

I don't want to talk about the specifications of the card too much; there are plenty of articles on that, as well as NVIDIA's own page for the card [here](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-titan-x). However, I will say (without suggesting that you do this and stating that you assume all risk associated with doing so should you choose to) that the Titan X overclocks very well [^oc].

What I would like to talk about is the Titan X's performance with regard to one (highly anticipated) game specifically: *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt*.

### Graphics

The Witcher 3 is a graphically intense game [^witcher2] and utilizes NVIDIA's new HairWorks technology which (apparently) makes hair on all of the characters, monsters, etc. more realistic. While I don't know the inner workings of the technology, I understand that it creates a texture for each strand of hair and seems to dynamically calculate each strand's behavior. The effect is *very* visible in game.

I have been playing The Witcher 3 a bit 1440p (for reasons I will discuss further on) and I don't see any framerate drops, strobing, or ghosting [^pc]. However, I mainly play in 1080p (the biggest screen I could find is this resolution) with the settings maxed out. Again, I see no strobing, ghosting, or framerate drops, even in crowded areas or during battles.

### Gameplay

Full disclosure: I have only played The Witcher 3 for about 4 hours (my day job has been running into my nights and weekends). Even with this relatively small amount of time, I have still seen what I think is enough to judge some of the gameplay. 

First, the controls: they seem much more intuitive on the PC than in The Witcher 2, with the exception of the dodging being bound by default to the ALT key; this makes dodging difficult without hand gymnastics. As a result of this simple defect, I have been playing with a controller.

Next, the interface is awesome in that it keeps out of your way as much as possible, but is there when you need it. Along with the interface, the crafting scheme is nice; you have many "recipes" to start with, but you can purchase or find more as the game progresses.

Last but not least is combat. Combat in The Witcher 3 is intuitive, but not too easy. There is a certain amount of strategy involved, from researching different enemies' weaknesses in the game's bestiary, to pre-combat potion drinking. The beauty of Geralt is the fact that he's not a tank and this is not a "hack'n'slash" where you can just run in and take on five enemies at once. The combat requires thought, planning, and not a little bit of dexterity and finesse. 

### Story

As previously stated, I have only delved into Wild Hunt for about four hours. However, as someone who notoriously loses interest in most things *very* quickly, the story pulled me right in and I can't wait to get done writing this post [^breakfast] so that I can continue playing.

Geralt makes a wonderful main character; he is morally ambiguous enough to not sway your decisions in the game, but is also human enough to allow one to empathize with him. His gravelly voice, razer-sharp wit, and sarcasm make him likable. His status as an outsider (a pariah even) make him mysterious and intriguing.

The dialog in Wild Hunt are spectacular, and show a literary flair and variation that (in my humble opinion) are often lacking in video games. As a result, the level of immersion is perfect. 

### Summation

I am by no means a seasoned game reviewer (which I am sure is readily apparent for anyone reading this), but I have to say that if you enjoy an engrossing story, well-paced gameplay, and beautiful (and not unattainable) graphics, you should just buy this game.

Buy it now.

Seriously.

[^oc]: On 3DMark's Firestrike test, my score jumped over 2000 points with just a little bit of overclocking. 

[^transistors]: This compared to the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980, which has a transistor count of (I believe) 5.4 billion.

[^witcher2]: Perhaps not as ahead of its time as The Witcher 2 which, released in 2011, still makes graphics cards sweat at high settings.

[^pc]: I tested the game on a computer with an Intel i7-4790K @ 4.4 GHz, 32 GB of RAM, and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX Titan X.
