My name is Larry Markley. I am a trained physicist, not-so-trained programmer, and "tech support guy" extraordinaire (not *just* self proclaimed).

I work as a tech support manager in Northeastern Ohio. I enjoy reading, gaming, and playing with my dogs two Labs, a Chow mix, a German Shepherd, and a Pug (who is actually in charge).

I have a B.A. in physics, specializing in computational physics (my senior thesis was on general relativity, simulating exotic space-time configurations). Until recently I was in graduate school in physics, but decided to pursue other goals.
