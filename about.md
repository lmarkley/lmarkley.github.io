Hi. I'm Larry. I'm starting out as a guy with a BA in physics, an affinity for programming, and not much to do. I work in tech support (it's as exciting as you'd expect) and I enjoy what I do. 

I specialize in computational physics, applied specifically to biophysics and general relativity. I think math is fun.

In my spare time (what's left of it anyway) I am an avid PC gamer, PC builder, tinkerer, and a fan of good literature. I also scuba dive and am trying to get my private pilot's license. 

I particularly enjoy making things seem more interesting than they really are.
